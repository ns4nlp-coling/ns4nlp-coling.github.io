The goal of neuro-symbolic methods is to combine symbolic representations and neural networks to benefit from the complementary strengths of the two paradigms. These ideas have a long history in AI and currently experience a resurgence of interest in several AI communities, including NLP. This tutorial targets researchers and practitioners interested in applying and advancing the use of these methods for natural language processing problems. A major goal of this tutorial is to provide a framework for analyzing the different modeling and algorithmic choices when combining symbolic and neural models for knowledge representation, learning and reasoning.
